JS 101
Your task is to build your own digital library using JavaScript. You will be focusing on building most of the interface components as a proof of concept. You will build your app using many important aspects of JavaScript including, objects, functions, primitives, loops, and use the console for debugging purposes.
Requirements
Library
● Library code should utilize functions
● Your library must have a “books” property which must be an array.
○ The array will contain book objects
● Your library must have the following public functions
○ getBookByTitle(title)
Purpose: Return all books that completely or partially matches the string title passed into the function
Return: array of book objects if you find books with matching titles, empty array if no books are found
○ getBooksByAuthor(authorName)
Purpose: Finds all books where the author’s name partially or completely matches the authorName argument passed to the function.
Return: array of books if you find books with match authors, empty array if no books match
○ getRandomBook()
Purpose: Return a random book object from your books array
Return: book object if you find a book, null if there are no books
○ addBook(book)
Purpose: Add a book object to your books array.
Return: boolean true if it is not already added, false if it is already added.
○ addBooks(books)
Purpose: Takes multiple books, in the form of an array of book objects, and adds the objects to your books array.
Return: number of books successfully added, 0 if no books were added
○ getAuthors()
Purpose: Find the distinct authors’ names from all books in your library
Return: array of strings the names of all distinct authors, empty array if no books exist or if no authors exist
○ getRandomAuthorName()
Purpose: Retrieves a random author name from your books collection
Return: string author name, null if no books exist
Book
○ removeBookByTitle(title)
Purpose: Remove book from the books array by its title.
Return: boolean true if the book(s) were removed, false if no books match
○ removeBookByAuthor(authorName)
Purpose: Remove a specific book from your books array by the author name.
Return: boolean true if the book(s) were removed, false if no books match
● A book must be an object
● A book object must have the following properties:
○ title - string representing the title of the song
○ author - string representing the authors name
○ numberOfPages - number representing the total page numbers
○ publishDate - javascript date object representing the date the book was published
Bonus
App
● Use localstorage (http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp) and JSON.stringify to save the state of your library
● Add a more robust search function to your app to allow you to filter by one or more book properties
○ the search function should return an array of book instances
● Make your library a singleton
○ A prototyped book class should also be made, with each ‘book’ in your library being an instance of the book class.
